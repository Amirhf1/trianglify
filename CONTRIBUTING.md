Contributing to Trianglify
==========================

Thank you for reading this! If you'd like to report a bug or join in the development
of Trianglify, then here are some notes on how to do that.

Reporting bugs and opening issues
---------------------------------

If you'd like a report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a üëç.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

Pull Requests
-------------

We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into Trianglify.

If you've got an idea for a change then please discuss it in the open first, 
either by opening an issue, or by joining us in our
[MDG public chat room](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/chat).

If you're looking for something to work on, have a look at the open issues in the repository [here](https://github.com/sdsmdg/trianglify/issues).

MDG Chat Room
-------------------

If you want to ask any questions in real-time, or get a feel for what's going on
then please drop into our [MDG public chat room](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/chat).
If no one is online then you can still leave a message that will hopefully get a reply
when we return.

Security
--------

Please do not publish security vulnerabilities publicly until we've had a chance
to address them. All security related issues/patches should be sent directly to
[sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com](mailto:sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com) where we will attempt to address them quickly. If you're
unsure whether something is a security issue or not, then please be cautious and
contact us at [sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com](mailto:sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com) first.
